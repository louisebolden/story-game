# Story Game

* Firebase
* Webpack

Very much pre-pre-alpha. This game has only two locations and a basic movement system.

Next up: picking up items, carrying items and putting items down.

## To run this project

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:louiseswift/story-game.git
  cd story-game
  npm install
  webpack --watch # to compile the JavaScript files
```

Run a local server using something like [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) and visit the local URL to run the app.
